We at Samrin Tea Estates PLC know that if passion, hard work and excellence go into an endeavour, the outcome will be a quality experience, and therefore rewarding. <br> We confess we are obsessed over the quality of our teas - our Ceylon Black Tea, Ceylon Green Tea and Ceylon Speciality Tea. The results are evident in every cup of tea made in our tea gardens.
